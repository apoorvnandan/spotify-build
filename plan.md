## Day by day plan
Every day we are going to work on one part of the app.

All the code is here on Github, so you can move faster if you want. But, I would recommend working for an hour or two every day on each part, and then trying to implement some extra bits on the same part to really become familiar with the concepts. e.g. We will work on implementing a "Login with Spotify" functionality on one day. Ideally, you should implement that, and then try and implement a Login with Twitter, or implement multiple login options!

Each day I will post my recording of writing the code for the relevant part - but it will not be a smoothly typed coding tutorial. Instead I will focus more on explaining what to look for in docs and on the process of figuring out everything I coded.

Day 1 - Authentication
Day 2 - Sidebar and playlist view in center
Day 3 - Player 
Day 4 - Search and library page
Day 5 - Artists page

## Discussions
I have a thesis that this will turn out to be the most fruitful part of all of this. I think it's better to go through builds like this as a community, where you can ask your questions, get help wherever you are stuck and just learn from each other in general.
So, whatever happens on your computer as you code this, I want you to show your screenshots, your bugs, your enhancements on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/Aw3vsWtGgH). There's so many other people working on the same project!
